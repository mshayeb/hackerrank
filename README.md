* **Sherlock and Watson** John Watson performs an operation called Right Circular Rotation on an integer array [a0, a1, … an-1]. Right Circular Rotation transforms the array from [a0, a1, … aN-1] to [aN-1, a0,… aN-2].He performs the operation K times and tests Sherlock’s ability to identify the element at a particular position in the array. He asks Q queries. Each query consists of one integer, idx, for which you have to print the element at index idx in in the rotated array, i.e., aidx. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/ArraysSorting/SherlockWatson.py)
* **Sherlock and Pairs** Sherlock is given an array of N integers A0, A1...AN-1 by Watson. Now Watson asks Sherlock how many different pairs of indices i and j exist such that i is not equal to j but Ai is equal to Aj.That is, Sherlock has to count total number of pairs of indices (i, j) where Ai = Aj AND i != j. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/ArraysSorting/SherlockPairs.py)

Search:

You have to display the indices of the two flavors whose sum is M. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/IceCream.py)
* **Encryption** An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme. First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/Encryption.py)
* **Count Luck** Hermione Granger is lost in the Forbidden Forest while collecting some herbs for a magical potion. The forest is magical and has only one exit point, which magically transports her back to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/CountLuck.py)
* **Sherlock and Array** Watson gives Sherlock an array A of length N. Then he asks him to determine if there exists an element in the array such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. If there are no elements to the left/right, then the sum is considered to be zero. Formally, find an i, such that, A1+A2…Ai-1 =Ai+1+Ai+2…AN. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/SherlockArray.py)
* **Circle City** Roy lives in a city that is circular in shape on a 2D plane that has radius r. The city center is located at origin (0,0) and it has suburbs lying on the lattice points (points with integer coordinates). The city Police Department Headquarters can only protect those suburbs which are located strictly inside the city. The suburbs located on the border of the city are still unprotected. So the police department decides to build at most k additional police stations at some suburbs. Each of these police stations can protect the suburb it is located in. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/CircleCity.py)
* **Missing Numbers** Numeros, the Artist, had two lists A and B, such that B was a permutation of A. Numeros was very proud of these lists. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers from A got left out. Can you find the numbers missing? [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/MissingNumbers.py)
* **The Grid Search** Given a 2D array of digits, try to find the location of a given 2D pattern of digits. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/GridSearch.py)
* **Number List** Shashank loves to play with arrays a lot. Today, he has an array A consisting of N positive integers. At first, Shashank listed all the subarrays of his array A on a paper and later replaced all the subarrays on the paper with the maximum element present in the respective subarray. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Search/NumberList.py)

String:

* **Funny String** Suppose you have a string S which has length N and is indexed from 0 to N−1. String R is the reverse of the string S. The string S is funny if the condition |Si−Si−1|=|Ri−Ri−1| is true for every i from 1 to N−1. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/FunnyString.py)
* **Pangrams** Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.) [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/Pangrams.py)
* **Alternating Characters** Shashank likes strings in which consecutive characters are different. For example, he likes ABABA, while he doesn’t like ABAA. Given a string containing characters A and B only, he wants to change it into a string he likes. To do this, he is allowed to delete the characters in the string. Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/AlternatingCharacters.py)
* **Gemstones** John has discovered various rocks. Each rock is composed of various elements, and each element is represented by a lower-case Latin letter from ‘a’ to ‘z’. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a gem-element if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks. Given the list of N rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/Gemstones.py)
* **Make it Anagram** Alice recently started learning about cryptography and found that anagrams are very useful. Two strings are anagrams of each other if they have same character set. For example strings"bacdc" and "dcbac" are anagrams, while strings "bacdc" and "dcbad" are not. Alice decides on an encryption scheme involving 2 large strings where encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. She need your help in finding out this number. Given two strings (they can be of same or different length) help her in finding out the minimum number of character deletions required to make two strings anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from any of the strings. [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/MakeItAnagram.py)
* **Anagram** Sid is obsessed with reading short stories. Being a CS student, he is doing some interesting frequency analysis with the books. He chooses strings S1 and S2 in such a way that |len(S1)−len(S2)| <= 1 [link](https://github.com/mshayeb/hackerrank/blob/master/Strings/Anagram.py)
